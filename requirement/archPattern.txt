Architectural Design PatternWe have architected the system using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).This is implemented as a Strict Closed Layered Architecture. The system is divided into 3 vertical layers with a unidirectional data flow.

2.1 Layer Breakdown (Mapped to Use Cases)

Layer 1: View (Presentation / UI Layer)Responsibility: Renders the UI and captures user interactions. Contains NO business logic.

Layer 2: ViewModel (State Management Layer)Responsibility: Acts as the bridge between View and Model. Implemented via React Custom Hooks. It manages local UI state (Loading, Error, Form Input) and invokes the Service Layer.

Layer 3: Model Layer 
    Inside got two folder :
    1.Service :
    Responsibility: The core business logic. This layer is Pure TypeScript and is 100% shared between Mobile and Web in the Monorepo. It acts as the system's "Gatekeeper"

    2.Repository (Data Access)
    Responsibility: Abstraction layer for Data Access. Converts Service instructions into Supabase SDK calls.Key Components: UserRepository, ServiceRequestRepository, ServiceListingRepository, EventRepository, FeedbackRepository.
