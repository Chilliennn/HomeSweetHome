Technology Stack Strategy
Our project adopts a Monorepo (Monolithic Repository) strategy. This approach allows us to maintain distinct user experiences for different platforms while maximizing code reusability for business logic.

1.1 Frontend Strategy (UI Layer)
We utilize a "Separated UI, Shared Logic" approach to ensure optimal User Experience (UX) for each stakeholder.

Mobile Application (User Side): React Native (Expo)

Target Actors: Elderly, Service Provider.

Justification: React Native provides a near-native mobile experience essential for the Elderly (large text, gesture navigation, ease of use) and Service Providers (real-time notifications, mobile job management). We use Expo for rapid prototyping and easy access to native modules (Camera, Location).

Web Admin Dashboard (Admin Side): React.js + Ant Design

Target Actor: Admin.

Justification: The Admin workflow involves reviewing complex data tables (eKYC verification) and managing content moderation. React.js combined with Ant Design (a desktop-first UI library) offers superior data grid capabilities, filtering, and information density compared to mobile-first frameworks like React Native Web.

1.2 Backend & Infrastructure
Supabase: Chosen as the primary backend-as-a-service (BaaS) for PostgreSQL Database, Authentication, and Realtime subscriptions.

Google Gemini API: Utilized for Generative AI features, specifically Sentiment Analysis (safety filtering) and Topic Recommendation.

ZegoCloud SDK: For integrated in-app video calling.
