BASIC FLOW
USER
SYSTEM


1. This use case begins when the system loads and displays the Stage Progress Dashboard. [M1: Msg Display Dashboard] [UC200_1]
2. The user views the dashboard.
3. The user performs interactions and activities associated with the current stage.  [A2: User Attempts to Access Locked Feature]
4. At any time, if the user selects “Withdraw from Match”, activate UC201_WITHDRAW_FROM_MATCH. 
5. System captures and updates relationship metrics in real time. [A3: Conflicting/Delayed Metric Update] [UC200_12] [UC200_13]
6. System updates requirement statuses [C7: Requirement Status Definitions] [UC200_14] [UC200_10]
7. The system calculates and updates the progress percentage and elapsed days display. [UC200_9] [UC200_8]
8. When a milestone threshold is hit, the system sends milestone notifications to both users. [C4: Notification SLA] [M2: Msg Milestone Achieved] [UC200_15]
9. User views milestone notification.
10. The system evaluates whether all requirements for the current stage are fully completed. [A1: Requirements Not Complete] [C1: Stage Advancement Rule] [C6: Consistency] [UC200_3] [UC200_16]
11. The system automatically advances users to the next stage. [C2: No Manual Skip Rule] [M5: Msg Stage Advanced] [UC200_4] [UC200_5]
12. System unlocks features associated with the newly reached stage and updates feature access. [UC200_6] [UC200_18]
13. System refreshes the dashboard to reflect the new stage and a preview of upcoming locked features. [C3: Real-Time Requirements] [UC200_7] [UC200_11]
14. System logs the stage change and feature lock/unlock events. [C5: Audit Trail] [UC200_20]
15. Use case ends.
ALTERNATE FLOW
A1: Requirements Not Complete 
A1.1 System shows message that some requirements remain incomplete. [M3: Msg Requirements Incomplete] [UC200_3] [UC200_19]
A1.2 System highlights incomplete items in the checklist. [UC200_10]
A1.3 User continues interactions, returning to BF:3.
A2: User Attempts to Access Locked Feature
A2.1 User selects a feature unavailable at the current stage.
A2.2 System denies access and displays friendly restriction messages with reason and expected unlock stage/time. [M4: Msg Feature Locked] [UC200_17] [UC200_19] [UC200_11]
A2.3 System logs the attempted access event. [UC200_20]
A2.4 System returns to BF:1.
A3: Conflicting/Delayed Metric Update
A3.1 System detects conflicting updates or delayed metric sync. [UC200_13][UC200_20]
A3.2 System applies reconciliation policy, such as merge, last-write wins, or de-duplication and re-evaluates requirement statuses. [C6: Consistency] [UC200_14]
A3.3 If reconciliation succeeds, resume BF at Step 4. [A4: Metric Sync Failure]
A4: Metric Sync Failure
A4.1 System displays metric synchronization error. [M6: Msg Metric Sync Error]
A4.2 System logs the incident. [UC200_20]
A4.3 System returns to BF:1.




MESSAGE [M]
M1: Msg Display Dashboard = {“Stage: [name]; Days elapsed: [n]; Progress: [x%]; Requirements: [list with statuses]; Locked features previewed.”} 

M2: Msg Milestone Achieved = {“Milestone reached: [milestone]. Congratulations!”} 

M3: Msg Requirements Incomplete = {“Some requirements are still incomplete. See checklist for details.”} 

M4: Msg Feature Locked = {“This feature unlocks at: [Stage name / date]. Keep interacting to unlock it.”} 

M5: Msg Stage Advanced = {“You have progressed to: [New Stage]. New features unlocked.”} 

M6: Msg Metric Sync Error = {“We detected an issue updating activity metrics. Please try again later.”}

M7: Msg Journey Completed = {"Congratulations! You have completed the Family Life stage and the full adoption journey."}
CONSTRAINT [C]
C1: Stage Advancement Rule 
All checklist items must be marked completed and validated before automatic stage progression.

C2: No Manual Skip Rule 
Users cannot manually skip or forcibly accelerate stage changes; only system-driven progression is allowed.

C3: Real-Time Requirements 
Activity metrics and dashboard updates must be processed in real time. 

C4: Notification SLA 
Milestone notifications must be delivered within 10s

C5: Audit Trail 
All stage changes, lock/unlock events, and denied access attempts are logged for auditing. 

C6: Consistency
Concurrent metric updates must be reconciled using a deterministic policy (e.g., timestamp ordering or last-write-wins) to ensure accurate requirement evaluation.

C7: Requirement Status Definitions
Requirement statuses must follow the standard state model:
Not Started – no activity recorded
In Progress – partial metrics or partially completed tasks
Completed – all required metrics and tasks for that requirement are fully met
The system must assign exactly one status to each requirement at any time.

Stage unlocked features design:
Stage 1 — Getting Acquainted

Unlocked Features
	•	Voice Call
	•	AI-assisted Conversation Suggestions
(lightweight — NOT activity suggestions yet)

Reasoning
	•	Early interactions should stay simple and low-risk.
	•	Text and small conversation nudges help both parties warm up.
	•	No diary or scheduling yet to avoid overwhelming new pairs.

⸻

Stage 2 — Building Trust

Unlocked Features
	•	Video Calls
	•	Scheduling Feature
	•	Basic Diary Feature (writing only, no AI analysis yet)

Reasoning
	•	By Stage 2, they’ve demonstrated:
	•	sustained chatting (4 hours / 2 weeks)
	•	weekly calls
	•	deeper sharing of expectations and life moments
These interactions require more coordination → Scheduling becomes appropriate.
	•	Allow diary writing to help them express themselves privately but AI should not yet suggest activities — trust is still forming.
	•	Video calls become possible because safety risk is lower after consistent monitored interaction.

⸻

Stage 3 — Family Bond

Unlocked Features
	•	Photo Sharing
	•	Full Diary with AI Analysis + AI Activity Suggestions
	•	AI-driven “Memory Collection” insights (from diaries & chats)

Reasoning
	•	At this stage, they:
	•	meet offline
	•	maintain consistent weekly calls
	•	help each other with tasks
This signals a solid relationship foundation.
	•	Now it’s safe and meaningful to:
	•	allow photo sharing (family album style)
	•	let AI analyse shared experiences and diaries to give personalized activity suggestions
	•	This is where the AI diary becomes powerful, enabling your bonding and activity progression features.

⸻

Stage 4 — Full Adoption Preparation

Unlocked Feature
	•	Home Visit Scheduling / Support (optional depending on your NGO policy)
	•	Full Feature Set Enabled

Reasoning
	•	This stage involves:
	•	final long call
	•	mutual agreement to adopt
	•	final NGO review
	•	All other features have already been unlocked earlier, so here the system does not need major new features.
	•	If your system includes home visits or external confirmations, this is the stage where they can be scheduled.
