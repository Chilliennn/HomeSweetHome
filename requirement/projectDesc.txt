Project Description  

 

The proposed project is an innovative digital platform designed to connect the younger generation with 		elderly individuals who are seeking companionship, emotional support, and a sense of belonging. The 		platform aims to bridge the intergenerational gap by allowing users to form meaningful, family-like 		relationship without the need for blood relations. 

 

The application provides a guided matching process, communication tools, relationship-building stages, and 	safety monitoring features to ensure a positive and trustworthy experience for all users. Below is an 		overview of the key modules and what users can do within the app: 

 

Matching and Communication  

 

Elder Profile Discovery: 

Users can browse verified elderly profiles, including personal background, interests, and communication preferences. 

 

Adoption Application Workflow:  

Youth users submit an adoption request expressing their intention to support and connect with an elderly individual. 

 

Real-Time Communication: 

Once matched, both parties gain access to text, voice, and multimedia messaging through an elderly-friendly chat interface. 

 

Video Communication: 

Built-in video call capabilities allow face-to-face interaction and strengthen emotional bonding 

 

Staged Relationship and Communication 

 

Stage Progression System: 

The bonding journey is divided into four clear stages: Getting to Know (3 weeks) → Trial Period (1 month) → Official Ceremony → Family Life. Each stage has specific duration requirements and recommended activities. 

 

Stage 1 begins with an anonymous introduction phase (first 7 days) where both parties chat with limited identity information to test compatibility without pressure. After this period, full profiles are revealed and the relationship continues building trust through structured interactions. 

 

Progress Dashboard: 

Users can view their relationship progress, completed activities, interaction frequency, and upcoming goals. 

 

Stage Requirements Check: 

Before moving to the next stage, the system evaluates whether required interactions or tasks have been completed. 

 

 

Feature Lock / Unlock: 

Certain features (such as video calls or shared memories) unlock as the relationship grows to ensure a safe and gradual bonding process. 

 

Family Life and Memory Management 

 

Family Photo Album: 

A shared space where both sides can upload photos, videos, and special moments together. 

 

Shared Calendar & Plans: 

Users can schedule virtual meetups, outings, health check-ins, or other planned activities. 

 

Personal Diary Entry (Voice/Text): 

Elderly and youth can log personal thoughts or stories. Voice diary entries help users who prefer speaking rather than typing. 

 

AI Activity Recommend: 

An AI assistant suggests bonding activities such as conversation starters, virtual games, shared hobbies, or volunteer tasks. 

 

Safety & Relationship Health Motoring  

 

Report Safety Concern: 

Users can submit safety reports regarding inappropriate behaviour, emotional distress, or conflict. 

 

Relationship Health Monitor: 

The system analyses communication health—detecting inactivity, misunderstandings, or potential issues. 

 

AI Analysis for Sentiment and Risk:  

AI monitors chat sentiment to flag signs of loneliness, emotional distress, scams, or abusive behaviour, ensuring both elderly and youth remain protected. 

 

Admin and Safety Monitoring 

 

Manage Application: 

Every adoption request is reviewed by the system or admin to ensure sincerity and safety. 

 

Handle Safety Alert: 

Admins receive risk alerts generated by the monitoring system, prioritise cases, and take appropriate action. 

 

Advisor Support & Consultation Channel Setup:  

When a user requests assistance, admins assign a family advisor and initiate a dedicated communication channel to facilitate guidance and conflict resolution. 

 

To ensure safety and trust, the platform will include identity verification, user reviews, and monitoring features by the NGO third party to protect vulnerable users. The goal of our product is to reduce loneliness, promote emotional well-being, and foster mutual learning between generations where the elderly can share wisdom and experience, while the youth gain empathy, respect, and life lessons.
